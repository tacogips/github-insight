# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working with this codebase.

## Response Rules

**CRITICAL: FIRST RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS** - These rules MUST be followed in the every response of a conversation:

1. **MANDATORY OPENING**: Start the very first response in any new conversation with exactly this phrase: "I will continue thinking and providing output in English."
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE CLAUDE.MD**: Explicitly state "I acknowledge reading CLAUDE.md and will use CARGO_TERM_QUIET=true for cargo commands."
3. **INSTRUCTION PARSING**: For English instructions, begin with "Your instruction is {corrected English}"

**Additional Response Rules**:

- Always respond in English regardless of user's language
- Declare cargo commands use CARGO_TERM_QUIET=true
- Follow all subsequent rules in this document

### Task Management

**Special Commands**:

- "show tasks/todos" â†’ Display current session TODOs
- "show plan" â†’ Display planned tasks
- "continue tasks" â†’ Start working on pending tasks

## How to change code

**MANDATORY** Never delete tests without deliberation

### Pre-modification Review Check

1. Search for review comments in modification area (`REV-` prefix)
2. Check commit history for review context
3. Respect review guidance unless functional changes require deviation

### Required Steps

1. Follow code style guidelines
2. Update documentation (//!, ///) and verify: `CARGO_TERM_QUIET=true cargo doc --no-deps`
3. **Commit Only When Requested**: Commits should only be made when explicitly instructed by the user:

   a) Stage files (`git add`)
   b) Show summary with message and diff stats
   c) Execute commit
   d) Show result

**Summary Format**: Files, TODOs, Future Plan, commit message
**Color Coding**: ðŸ”´ Deletions, ðŸŸ¢ Additions/Modifications, ðŸŸ¡ Renames

**IMPORTANT**: Never skip steps unless explicitly told.

### Test Guidelines

- Fix code to make tests pass (never remove test cases)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Maintain test coverage and strictness
- Use designated test resources:
  - Repository: https://github.com/tacogips/gitcodes-mcp-test-1
  - Project: https://github.com/users/tacogips/projects/1
- Include meaningful assertions with appropriate timeouts

### Communication Guidelines

- Seek clarification for ambiguous instructions
- Understand user goals before implementation
- Present options when unsure about details

### Git Commit Policy

- Follow commit message format from this document
- Auto-proceed without user confirmation
- **NO Claude Code attribution** - commits appear as user-made only
- Execute all "How to change code" steps above before completing

### Git Commit Message Format

**Structure** (9 sections):

1. **Objective**: Purpose, goals, challenges addressed
2. **Primary Changes**: Main changes and intent
3. **Key Technical Concepts**: Technologies, frameworks involved
4. **Files and Code Sections**: Modified files with summaries
5. **Problem Solving**: Issues addressed (include bug reproduction for fixes)
6. **Impact**: Effect on overall project
7. **Related Commits**: `Related: abc123d, def456a`
8. **Unresolved TODOs**: `- [ ]` format
9. **Future Plan**: `- [ ]` format

**Bug Fix Rule**: Always include reproduction method in commit log with fictional values for sensitive data.

      "command": "/path/to/github-insight-mcp",
      "args": ["stdio", "--timezone", "America/New_York", "--profile", "work"],
      "env": { "GITHUB_INSIGHT_GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_token" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Quiet Cargo Commands

Use `CARGO_TERM_QUIET=true` prefix to reduce output.

## CLI Usage

### Running CLI

```bash
# Basic usage
cargo run --bin github-insight-cli -- [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

# With environment variables
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_token cargo run --bin github-insight-cli -- [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>
```

### Global Options

- `--format <FORMAT>`: Output format (json, markdown) [default: markdown]
- `--github-token <GITHUB_TOKEN>`: GitHub personal access token
- `--timezone <TIMEZONE>`: Timezone for datetime formatting (e.g., "JST", "+09:00", "America/New_York", "UTC")
- `--request-timeout <REQUEST_TIMEOUT>`: Request timeout in seconds [default: 30]

### Commands

#### Profile Management

- `create-profile`: Create a new profile for organizing repositories and projects with optional description
- `delete-profile`: Delete a profile and all its associated repository and project registrations (irreversible)
- `list-profiles`: Display all available profiles with their configurations and metadata

#### Repository Management

- `register-repo`: Register a repository to a profile for centralized management and search operations
- `unregister-repo`: Remove a repository from a profile, excluding it from search and management operations
- `list-repos`: Display all repositories registered in a specific profile with their URLs and registration details

#### Project Management

- `register-project`: Register a GitHub project to a profile for comprehensive resource management and tracking with pagination support
- `unregister-project`: Remove a GitHub project from a profile, excluding it from resource management and tracking
- `list-projects`: Display all GitHub projects registered in a specific profile with their URLs and metadata

#### Data Operations

- `search`: Search for issues and pull requests across multiple repositories with advanced GitHub search syntax and pagination support. Use `get-issues` and `get-pull-requests` commands to get more detailed information. Note: Repository specifications (repo:owner/name) within the query are not supported and will be ignored - repository filtering is handled by the --repository-url option (expects full GitHub URL format) and registered repositories in the profile

- `get-pull-requests`: Fetch detailed pull request information including comments, metadata, reviews, and timeline events by URLs (formatted as markdown with comprehensive details)

#### General

- `help`: Print help message or help for specific subcommands

## Code Style Guidelines

- Rust 2024 edition, rustfmt default settings
- snake_case naming, prefer Result<T,E> over unwrap()
- Organize imports: std first, then external crates
- Use structured logging (env_logger, tracing)
- Type annotations for public functions
- Effective ownership system (avoid unnecessary clones)
- Module declaration order: `pub mod`, `mod`, `pub use`, `use` (each block separated by blank line)
- Place structs/enums with their implementations together

### Implementation Principles

- **Divide and Conquer**: Apply divide and conquer approach to break down complex implementations into appropriate methods and split files as needed for maintainability
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Properly consolidate common processing logic and avoid recreating existing shared functionality. Always check for existing common utilities before implementing new ones
- **Code Reusability**: Identify and extract reusable components into separate modules or functions to promote code sharing across the codebase
- **Modular Design**: Structure code into logical modules with clear responsibilities and minimal coupling between components

### General Coding Principles

**SOLID Principles**:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/struct should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

**Clean Code Practices**:

- **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive, searchable names that express intent
- **Small Functions**: Functions should do one thing well (max 20-30 lines)
- **Function Arguments**: Minimize argument count (ideally 0-2, maximum 3)
- **Comments**: Code should be self-documenting; comments explain "why", not "what"
- **Consistent Formatting**: Follow project's formatting standards religiously

**Error Handling & Robustness**:

- **Fail Fast**: Detect and report errors as early as possible
- **Graceful Degradation**: System should continue operating with reduced functionality
- **Input Validation**: Always validate inputs at system boundaries
- **Resource Management**: Properly handle resource cleanup (RAII pattern)
- **Defensive Programming**: Assume inputs can be malicious or malformed

**Performance & Efficiency**:

- **Premature Optimization**: Avoid unless profiling shows actual bottlenecks
- **Big O Awareness**: Understand algorithmic complexity of your solutions
- **Memory Management**: Minimize allocations, avoid memory leaks
- **Lazy Loading**: Load resources only when needed
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache expensive operations with appropriate invalidation

**Testing & Quality**:

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation when possible
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high coverage but focus on critical paths
- **Test Isolation**: Tests should be independent and repeatable
- **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for external services/APIs
- **Integration Tests**: Test the complete flow of critical features

**Security & Safety**:

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Input Sanitization**: Never trust user input; validate and sanitize
- **Secure Defaults**: Use secure configurations by default
- **Secrets Management**: Never hardcode credentials; use environment variables
- **Audit Trail**: Log security-relevant events for monitoring

### Rust-Specific Guidelines

**Error Handling & Reliability**:

- Always use `Result<T, E>` instead of `unwrap()` or `panic!()`
- Implement proper error propagation using `?` operator
- Use `anyhow` for error handling in application code
- Handle all async operations with proper timeout handling

**Performance & Memory**:

- Avoid unnecessary `clone()` operations - use references when possible
- Use `ahash` for HashMap operations (already in dependencies)
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Use streaming for large API responses

**Async Programming**:

- Use tokio runtime features appropriately
- Implement proper cancellation handling
- Use `futures` utilities for complex async operations
- Apply timeouts to external API calls

**Security**:

- Never log sensitive data (tokens, personal information)
- Use `rustls` for TLS connections
- Validate all external inputs
- Use secure defaults for HTTP clients

**Testing & Documentation**:

- Write unit tests for all public functions
- Use `mockito` for HTTP mocking in tests
- Document all public APIs with `///` comments
- Use `serial_test` for tests requiring isolation

**GitHub API Integration**:

- Use `octocrab` client consistently
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Handle GraphQL pagination correctly
- Cache responses appropriately using `tantivy`

**Configuration Management**:

- Use `toml` for configuration files
- Support environment variables
- Implement profile-based configuration
- Use `dirs` for platform-specific paths
